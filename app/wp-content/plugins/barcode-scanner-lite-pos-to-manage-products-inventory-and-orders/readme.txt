This plugin for WooCommerce allows you to scan barcodes and manage your inventory/orders more efficiently. After barcode is scanned, plugin starts to search item automatically and displays product/order you were looking for. Also this plugin provides Point Of Sale (POS) functionality, so you can create WooCommerce orders right from the work place or checkout counter.

You can also switch to the "Enter" mode and search products/orders manually by typing ID/SKU/NAME/etc - and product/order will be found. 

We pay a lot of attention to search speed optimization, so even shops with thousands of items can count on fast responsiveness and comfortable work.

Plugin is fully compatible with WooCommerce.
